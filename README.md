Turn-based two player game, my first GitHub post.

Players move around a board collecting bonus points while attempting to destroy each other.

Game generates a square board of a size based on user-input, along with a random starting position for each robot, and randomly placed mystery bonus squares that either add give the Robot an additional point or decreases the oppenent's health when stepped on.

Controls are inputted by WASD keys and are entered through cmd line, input 'x' to abandon game, and 'z' to not move at all.

Board is displayed by printing on to the cmd line.

Changes to be made:

Making controls read automatically instead of manually inputted 

Using a proper display interface instead of printing onto cmd line, possibly in 3D 

Creating a AI to play against for single-player
